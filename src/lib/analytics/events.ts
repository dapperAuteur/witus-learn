/**
 * Event taxonomy for Learn.WitUS (learn.witus.online and its white-label tenants).
 *
 * The ecosystem shares ONE PostHog project, separated by the `app` property that
 * posthog-provider registers on load. Two rules keep that project readable, and both
 * are cheap now and expensive to retrofit once data has landed:
 *
 *   1. `snake_case`, object first, verb in past tense — `lesson_completed`.
 *   2. NEVER put the app name in the event name. `learn_lesson_completed` is wrong:
 *      it makes the same action from two apps look like two events and kills the
 *      cross-app comparison that sharing a project exists to enable. The `app`
 *      property already carries that.
 *
 * Shared lifecycle events (the SHARED_EVENTS block) use identical names in every
 * ecosystem app, so "where do people fall out of sign-in" is answerable across all of
 * them at once. Do not rename these here without renaming them everywhere.
 *
 * Canonical copy and full contract: witus-online lib/analytics/INTEGRATE.md.
