Goal: After this lesson you can write pure-code evaluators for routing accuracy and citation coverage, and wire them to a CI gate.

Follow along in the [Centenarian Coach repo](https://github.com/dapperAuteur/centenarian-coach-multiagent), and see it running at [the deployed coach](https://centenarian.coach.multiagent.witus.online/). On screen this lesson opens [`evals/rubric.ts`](https://github.com/dapperAuteur/centenarian-coach-multiagent/blob/course/lesson-17/evals/rubric.ts) and [`tests/coach.eval.test.ts`](https://github.com/dapperAuteur/centenarian-coach-multiagent/blob/course/lesson-17/tests/coach.eval.test.ts).

## Two axes you can check with code

Two of the three failure axes from Lesson 16 are checkable with plain code, no model required. Those deterministic evaluators are the cheapest, most reliable part of the suite, so they run on every pull request. They live in [`evals/rubric.ts`](https://github.com/dapperAuteur/centenarian-coach-multiagent/blob/course/lesson-17/evals/rubric.ts) and are pure functions, with no API and no network, which is why they unit-test cleanly and gate CI without spending tokens.

## Routing accuracy: an exact-set match

```ts
export function routingScore(state: CoachState, example: EvalExample): EvalScore {
  const got = [...(state.routing?.agents ?? [])].sort();
  const want = [...example.expectedAgents].sort();
  const correct = got.length === want.length && got.every((a, i) => a === want[i]);
  return { key: "routing_correct", score: correct ? 1 : 0,
    comment: correct ? undefined : `expected [${want.join(", ")}], got [${got.join(", ")}]` };
}
```

It compares the supervisor's chosen agents against the example's `expectedAgents` as a set (order-independent), and on a miss the `comment` says exactly what was expected and what came back, so a failing eval is also a bug report. This is only meaningful because routing is deterministic (Module 1's temperature-0 rule): the same question routes the same way every run, so a 0 is a real defect, not noise.

## Citation coverage: the promise, checked

```ts
export function citationScore(state: CoachState): EvalScore {
  const findings = Object.values(state.findings).filter(Boolean);
  const everyFindingCited = findings.length > 0 && findings.every((f) => f.citations.length > 0);
  const answerCited = (state.finalAnswer?.citations.length ?? 0) > 0;
  return { key: "citations_present", score: everyFindingCited && answerCited ? 1 : 0 };
}
```

It encodes the design's structural promise: every specialist finding carries at least one citation, and the final answer carries citations. Coverage doesn't check whether the citations are good (that's grounding, Lesson 18); it checks they're present. Cheap, binary, and exactly the kind of regression a refactor can break without anyone noticing.

## The gate

`pnpm eval` runs the evaluators across `evals/dataset.json` via [`tests/coach.eval.test.ts`](https://github.com/dapperAuteur/centenarian-coach-multiagent/blob/course/lesson-17/tests/coach.eval.test.ts) and fails if mean routing accuracy drops below 0.8 or citation coverage below 0.9:

```ts
expect(routingAccuracy).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0.8);
expect(citationCoverage).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0.9);
```

The run makes a real graph invocation per example, so it's opt-in (`RUN_EVALS=1`) and stays out of the fast default `pnpm test`. But the rubric functions themselves have pure unit tests (`evals.rubric.test.ts`) that run every time, so the evaluators are always protected even when the expensive full eval isn't run. A pull request that drops routing accuracy should fail this gate, not surprise a user (LangChain, 2025).

## In practice

Run `pnpm test evals.rubric.test.ts` (fast, no keys) to see the evaluators tested in isolation. Then, with keys set, run `pnpm eval` and read the per-question table. Find the lowest-scoring question and decide, before reading on, whether it's a routing problem or a grounding problem. Lesson 18 gives you the grounding number to confirm.

## Key Takeaways

- Routing and citation coverage are pure functions with no API or network, so they gate CI without spending tokens.
- Routing accuracy is an order-independent set match, and its `comment` on a miss doubles as a bug report.
- The routing score is only meaningful because routing is deterministic (temperature 0), so a 0 is a real defect.
- Citation coverage checks the structural promise (every finding and the answer cited), not whether citations are good.
- The gate fails below 0.8 routing / 0.9 citation; it's opt-in per run, but the rubric's own unit tests always protect the evaluators.
